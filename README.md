# Mega Man X: Command Mission Poptracker

This is a Poptracker package for the Mega Man X: Command Mission APWorld by TheMogul.

## Installation

Download and put it into your Poptracker/packs folder!

## Details
- Item Boxes, Rebellion Medals, and Chapter Bosses and Mechaniloids are currently automatically tracked
- You must click the Mettaur in the bottom left under Options to enable Mechaniloid display. (This is an option that will be included in the APWorld later)
- Characters are NOT tracked. Tracking characters does nothing for the logic right now, anyway.
- The tracker will say items behind Rafflesian and Duckbill Mole are out of logic until you click on them.
- The tracker does not display Treasure Tokens and the Eternal Forest as they are not currently implemented in the APWorld.
