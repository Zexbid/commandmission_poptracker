# Mega Man X: Command Mission Poptracker

This is a Poptracker package for the Mega Man X: Command Mission APWorld by TheMogul.

## Installation

Download and put it into your Poptracker/packs folder!

## Details
- All major checks of the APWorld are automatically tracked, this includes item boxes, Mechaniloids, and Bosses.
- You must click the Mettaur in the bottom left under Options to enable Mechaniloid display. (This is an option that will be included in the APWorld later)
- Characters are NOT tracked. Tracking characters does nothing for the logic right now, anyway.
- Some bosses need to be manually tracked, as they still contribute to logic, but aren't implemented in the APWorld as checks yet.
- - These Bosses are Gimialla Mine's Shadow (IMPORTANT), Tianna Camp's Rafflesian, and Melda Ore Plant's Duckbill Mole. (The items behind Rafflesian and Duckbill Mole are by default, not important in the yaml.)
